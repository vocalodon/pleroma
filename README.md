## About Pleroma

Pleroma is an OStatus-compatible social networking server written in Elixir, compatible with GNU Social and Mastodon. It is high-performance and can run on small devices like a Raspberry Pi.

For clients it supports both the [GNU Social API with Qvitter extensions](https://twitter-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and the [Mastodon client API](https://github.com/tootsuite/documentation/blob/master/Using-the-API/API.md).

Mobile clients that are known to work well:

* Twidere
* Tusky
* Pawoo (Android + iOS)
* Subway Tooter
* Amaroq (iOS)
* Tootdon (Android + iOS)

No release has been made yet, but several servers have been online for months already. If you want to run your own server, feel free to contact us at @lain@pleroma.soykaf.com or in our dev chat at #pleroma on freenode or via matrix at https://matrix.heldscal.la/#/room/#freenode_#pleroma:matrix.org.

## Installation

### Dependencies

* Postgresql version 9.6 or newer
* Elixir version 1.4 or newer (you will also need erlang-dev, erlang-parsetools, erlang-xmerl packages)
* Build-essential tools

### Configuration

  * Run `mix deps.get` to install elixir dependencies.

  * Run `mix generate_config`. This will ask you a few questions about your instance and generate a configuration file in `config/generated_config.exs`. Check that and copy it to either `config/dev.secret.exs` or `config/prod.secret.exs`. It will also create a `config/setup_db.psql`, which you need to run as PostgreSQL superuser (i.e. `sudo su postgres -c "psql -f config/setup_db.psql"`). It will setup a pleroma db user, database and will setup needed extensions that need to be set up once as superuser.

  * Run `mix ecto.migrate` to run the database migrations. You will have to do this again after certain updates.

  * You can check if your instance is configured correctly by running it with `mix phx.server` and checking the instance info endpoint at `/api/v1/instance`. If it shows your uri, name and email correctly, you are configured correctly. If it shows something like `localhost:4000`, your configuration is probably wrong, unless you are running a local development setup.

  * The common and convenient way for adding HTTPS is by using Nginx as a reverse proxy. You can look at example Nginx configuration in `installation/pleroma.nginx`. If you need TLS/SSL certificates for HTTPS, you can look get some for free with letsencrypt: https://letsencrypt.org/
  On Debian you can use `certbot` package and command to manage letsencrypt certificates.

  * [Not tested with system reboot yet!] You'll also want to set up Pleroma to be run as a systemd service. Example .service file can be found in `installation/pleroma.service` you can put it in `/etc/systemd/system/`.

## Running

By default, it listens on port 4000 (TCP), so you can access it on http://localhost:4000/ (if you are on the same machine). In case of an error it will restart automatically.

### As systemd service (with provided .service file)
Running `service pleroma start`
Logs can be watched by using `journalctl -fu pleroma.service`

### Standalone/run by other means
Run `mix phx.server` in repository's root, it will output log into stdout/stderr
